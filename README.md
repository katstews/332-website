# Alrighty, heres your guide how to set up this project 
First step is to download VS code, as this is how I set up the project. You will need to download __Live Server__ and __PHP Server__ as extensions to make this project work. Alright now that its set up, we go to our __index.hmtl__ file, which is in the pages folder. Were gonna right click on the page and click "PHP Server: Server project".
