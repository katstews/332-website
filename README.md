## Alrighty, heres your guide how to set up this project 
First step is to download VS code, as this is how I set up the project. You will need to download __Live Server__ and __PHP Server__ as extensions to make this project work. Alright now that its set up, we go to our __index.hmtl__ file, which is in the pages folder. Were gonna right click on the page and click "PHP Server: Server project".

Once that is done, the project should be able to work. 

## Loading the php ...
Honestly, php is not that bad. I dont know what the crazy rep is. Anyways, here how the php I did worked. 
The first php file I have is called config.php, that is basically a connection file so that I wont have to keep writting the same line of code in EVERY php file just to connect to my database.

Anyways, have fun playing around. Hope this was kinda clear.
